## starting to moving ack page to Maintance page

## 1.pass with the filter category in the request with the url search params

## 2. on the front end make a buttons that will open the big filter&sort section in the same button.name

## 3. cache the requests on the filter and sort and present length

## meaning if we got 5 requetss on filter user dont allowing to get more filters request it will get it from the caching,

## nor change the logic that will get a big request of all the products, and you will able to present some length of products filter on that
