# Summary: Pitfalls to Avoid and Tips for Keeping Code/Components Modular and Scalable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **Monolithic Components**:
   - Creating components with too much responsibility makes them hard to understand and maintain.
   - **Avoid**: Break down components into smaller pieces with clear roles (Single Responsibility Principle).

2. **Passing Excessive Props**:
   - Passing too many props creates unnecessary dependencies and makes the code less readable.
   - **Avoid**: Only pass the props that are essential for the child component.

3. **Improper State Management**:
   - Using local state for components that require shared state leads to tight coupling.
   - **Tip**: Use context or global state management (like Redux) for shared state across multiple components.

4. **Lack of Modularization**:
   - Writing code in long files without clear modular boundaries makes it hard to navigate and reuse.
   - **Tip**: Split the code into logical modules with clear imports and exports.

## Tips for Keeping Code Modular and Scalable:
- **Prefer Functional Components with Hooks**: Using hooks enables cleaner, more modular code.
- **Use `React.memo`**: To prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
- **Organize Your Project by Modules**: Keep related files in the same folder for better structure.
- **Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each component has a single, well-defined purpose.
- **Utilize Custom Hooks**: To separate complex logic from components and promote code reusability.

**Summary**: To keep your code modular and scalable, break down components and code into small, manageable modules, use hooks effectively, avoid passing unnecessary props, and manage state wisely.
